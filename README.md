# asteroids.explore()

### Welcome to our project! Here you will find guide on how to get our project up and running

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Put your model (in STL format) into the "models" directory
3. Open Solution.ipynb in Jupyter notebook (we recommend using the one included in Anaconda's distribution)
4. Run each cell (if you have required libraries installed, you may skip first cell)
5. In last cell, use sliders or input direct values to select directional rotation vector, spectator's plane (xy, yz, zx) and model from the "models" directory
6. Expect some beauty!
